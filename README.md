#Random Quote Generator
The randomGenerator is a simple JavaScript-based tool designed to generate random motivational quotes. It combines different parts of a quote to create a unique and inspiring message each time it's executed.

##Features
###Diverse Quote Starters: The generator uses a variety of quote starters such as "I am", "Today", and "My".

###Multiple Quote Endings: Depending on the starter, the generator selects from different sets of quote endings to ensure variety and relevance.

###Easy to Extend: You can easily add more quote starters and endings to the existing arrays to increase the diversity of generated quotes.

##How It Works
The generator randomly selects a quote starter and based on that starter, it chooses an appropriate ending. The selected parts are then combined to form a complete quote which is then logged to the console.

###Usage
Simply run the code.js file in any JavaScript environment to get a random quote:
